 *
 *	Create a program called number guesser --> DONE
 *	There will be a secret number that is set at the start of the program without any user input 
 *The Secret number should be picked from a certain range --> DONE
 *The range of the number should be output to the player --> DONE
 * the prompt should show how many guesses the player has left -->  DONE
 * The player enter his guess --> DONE
 * If the player guess is too high then the game will output that the guess was too high --> DONE
 * If the player guess is too low then the game will output the guess was too low -->DONE
 * The player only has a certain number of guesses --> DONE
 * The number of guesses should be based on the range of the secret number --> 
 * Any wrong guess will decrement the number of guesses left --> DONE
 * THe game ends by saying what the secret number was regardless of if the player guessed the right number
 * When the game is over, the player should be prompted if he would like to play again
 * If yes then the secret number should change
 * Any input Errors by the player should have proper handling
 *
 *
 *
 *	do {
 *
 *		Play The Game ;
 *
 *	}while( Want to play again)
 *
 *	Play the Game: 
 *		1. set the secret number 
 *		2. set the secret number range
 *		3. prompt the secret number to userdr
 *		4. set the number of guesses
 *		
 *		do {
 *			5. Prompt the user to make a guess ('Output the number of guesses left')
 *			6. Get the guees from the user
 *			7. Check the condition of the guess
 *				7a. if the guess is not equal to the secret number then 
 *					7a1. decrement the number of guess
 *					7a2. check if it was higher or lower than the secret number
 *						7a2a. if it was higher -> print (the guess was too high)
 *						7a2b. if it was lower -> print ( the guess was too low ) 
 *		}while(is not game over)
 *		
 *		Display the result -> tell the player if he got it or not
